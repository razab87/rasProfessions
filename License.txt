License: Project Zomboid is owned by The Indie Stone. Except for any restrictions imposed by The Indie Stone's modding policy or any third-party content contained in my mods, I consider all my mods to be open source in the sense that as long as you do not publish a plain copy of them on Steam, you are free to use any element of them, modify to your liking and share the results with the public. Note that some of my mods may contain third-party assets. These are either CC0, CC-BY or owned by The Indie Stone. In the latter case, they can only be used in accordance with The Indie Stone's property rights. In case of CC-BY, my mods contain a file listing the sources. Make sure to comply with the CC-BY license in case you want to re-use them.
