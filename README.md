All versions of the mod "ra's Professions" for the video game Project Zomboid. See the mod's workshop page on steam for info about the mod's content: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2675128168.

The mod is currently only available for the stable build 41 version of the game. It is not available for the unstable build 42 but I plan to update it when I have the time.

Manual installation:
1. Download the most recent version of the mod from the "Releases" section.
2. Extract the .zip folder.
3. From the extracted file, copy the folder "rasProfessions" from rasProfessions_[version]/Contents/mods/ to your Zomboid/mods folder.
